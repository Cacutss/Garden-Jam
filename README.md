# JamFrog
An audio visualizer with a twist, gives you customized per audio self-playing frogger!
created in librosa, pygame and ffmpeg for [boot.dev](https://boot.dev)'s 2025 Hackathon!

[![Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/u4MCWl5zK6Q/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4MCWl5zK6Q)

Jam to the music as the little frog commits repeated traffic violations, colorized!

Takes an audio file and returns a video file output with a frog dancing to the beats!
## Requirements
* **Python 3.12+**
* **[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)**
* **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)**
* **The audio file that you want to visualize - use a .wav file, if you don't the musical overnerds will smite you :)**
* Testing of the application was successful on Linux and WSL.
## Installation
Clone the repository or download the ZIP archive and extract its contents.
```
git clone https://github.com/Cacutss/JamFrog
```
If you don't have **uv** installed, you can install it [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation).
### Initialize the project:
```
uv init
```
### To avoid installing dependencies globally, it is recommended to use a virtual environment. To create a virtual environment:
```
uv venv
```
### To activate your virtual environment:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
### To install the dependencies, execute the following command:
```
uv add librosa pygame numpy scipy pillow
```
Note: Linux users may need to install tkinter if it is not already present on their system.  
For Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint:```sudo apt-get install python3-tk```  
Yum:```sudo yum install python3-tkinter```  
Dnf:```sudo dnf install python3-tkinter```
### Next, you'll need to install FFmpeg. You can find detailed installation instructions for your preferred method [HERE](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
For Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint: ``` sudo apt install ffmpeg```  
To verify installation: ```ffmpeg -version```

## Usage
### To launch JamFrog, execute the main.py file with the following command:
```
uv run main.py 
```
### Flags
For now there's just one flag.  
```
uv run main.py --tempo (number)
```
accepts any positive integer and represents the tempo of the audio chosen. Why user input? because librosa is very innacurate on this part.
You can refer to https://www.beatsperminuteonline.com/ on how to calculate those, anyways this program will try it's best to guess the audio tempo even if you don't specify it
